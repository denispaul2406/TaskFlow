# **App Name**: Task Flow

## Core Features:

- Project & Task Management: Create and manage projects with task lists. Projects can be personal or shared.
- Task Organization: Add, edit, and mark tasks as complete. Organize tasks with due dates, priorities, and statuses (To Do, Doing, Done).
- Collaboration: Option to invite other users to projects via email or link. Simple commenting/discussion on each task for updates.
- Status Updates: Submit short daily/weekly stand-up updates per project, for individual reflection or for sharing within a team. The system can tool the output to add positive reinforcement on accomplished tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted purple (#9D7CBF) to create a calm, focused atmosphere that avoids high energy or stress. 
- Background color: Very light purple (#F4F2F7), close in hue to the primary, to maintain overall calm, but desaturated for ease on the eyes. 
- Accent color: Blue (#7BA9BF) for interactive elements, calls to action, and visual cues. Creates a calm invitation to act.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, minimalist icons for project actions, task status, and collaboration features.
- Each project uses one clean, scrollable page. Task entry is a single-line textbox ('+' button). Tasks can be clicked to edit, swiped or have a checkbox to mark done.
- Subtle animations for task completion, updates, and user interactions, using a fade and slide motion.
